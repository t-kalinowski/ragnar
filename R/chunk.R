  # for tweaking a chunking approach to a particular corpus. The viewer shows:
  # - distinct boundaries between chunks
  # - print representation of text shown (i.e., cat() not print())
  # - makes it easy to quickly scan across lots of content:
  #     all chunks shown on one page, easy scroll, easy jump between chunks via sidebar?, interactive search?
  # - metadata (other columns like 'h1' , 'h2') shown adjacent to chunks
